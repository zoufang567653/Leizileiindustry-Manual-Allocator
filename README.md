# Filecoin Plus DataCap Allocator - Client Applications

Welcome to the GitHub repository dedicated to managing the Lifecycle Data Notations (LDN) Applications for a specific Filecoin Plus DataCap allocator team. This repository serves as a public ledger for DataCap allocation requests and tracking, facilitating transparency and efficiency in the process.

## Overview

Filecoin Plus (Fil+) enhances the utility of Filecoin by not just storing data, but also verifying the usefulness of the data being stored. DataCap is allocated to clients based on their storage needs and the value their data brings to the Filecoin network. Our team, operating under a shared multisig wallet, acts as an allocator of DataCap, assessing and verifying client requests.

## How It Works

Instead of a traditional code repository, this GitHub repo functions as a structured ledger to handle DataCap requests through Client Applications. Each application's lifecycle, from request to allocation, is publicly documented here.

### Requesting DataCap

1. **Open an Issue:** Clients looking to request DataCap must open a new issue in this repository. The issue should include detailed information about the project requiring DataCap. Essential information includes but is not limited to:
   - Project name and description
   - Amount of DataCap requested
   - Justification for the DataCap amount
   - Information about the data owner for KYC

2. **Filling the Application Template:** An issue template will guide clients through submitting the necessary information for their DataCap request.

### Review and Allocation Process

1. **Initial Review:** Once an issue is opened, our allocator team will conduct an initial review to ensure all necessary information is provided.
2. **Discussion & Clarification:** The team may engage in discussions within the issue thread for clarifications or additional information.
3. **Decision:** The allocator team will make a decision on the DataCap request. If approved, the process moves to the allocation phase.

### Managing the Client Application Lifecycle

- Each Client Application's lifecycle is tracked through a `.json` file in this repository, uniquely associated with the client's issue.
- The `.json` file is created when an application is initially approved for allocation and is updated through pull requests as more DataCap is allocated or as the application status changes.
- This structured approach ensures transparency and traceability for both clients and the allocator team.
